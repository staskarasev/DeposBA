## DeposBA: An explonatery data analysis on the real estate scene in Buenos Aires, Argentina.


### Background

I moved to Buenos Aires in 2017 and still I don't know many things about this city. I think analysing the real estate data is a greate way to explore the city.
Some of the questions I wanted to responde:

- Is it true, that Puerto Madero is the most expensive ditstrict?

- Why one people pay more expenses than another?

- Which district has the oldest apartments block?

- Are there any districts in the city with undervalued price?
